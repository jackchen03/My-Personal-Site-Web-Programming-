        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>I'm a student from Taiwan, studying in the National Taiwan University, major in Electrical Engineering. Now I'm learning web development because I want to work in the silicon valley one day. Hope my dream comes true.</p>

          <h3>Basketball</h3>
          <p>I'm not a really good basketball player since I'm rather short in height, but I really love basketball. I started to play basketball since I was six, and I still play for the varsity in college now. My favorite team in NBA is the OKC thunder, and my favorite player is Russell Westbrook.</p>

          <h3>Guitar</h3>
          <p class = "guitar-text">I'm currently a member of NTU guitar club, so I'm eager to improve my guitar skill. For now, I can only play songs with easy chords; therefore, I really want to improve my skill so I can play harder and cooler songs, maybe even write one myself.</p>
